# Writing Guidelines

We use a couple of different style guides for coursework submitted at TCM. Our style guides are located on the [Style Guides](https://kalebheitzman.gitbook.io/tcm/orientation-to-graduate-studies/analytical-thinking/style-guides) page and then more detailed information about writing style can be found for each of our different homework assignments.
