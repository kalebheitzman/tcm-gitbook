# Exegetical Papers

## **Research using Exegetical Skills**

“To preach and teach Biblically means not only to use the content of Scripture but to find its intent. That requires exegesis \(exegetical skills\)\*. In our preaching and teaching we affirm the authoritativeness of the Bible when we follow three general principles of interpretation that are derived from the character of the Bible itself as the Word of God in the words of men.

* We adopt the principle of clarity.  God has spoken in order to be understood, and we must study carefully the meaning of the words and grammar.
* We stress the principle of history.  God spoke on many occasions through various individuals to a variety of audiences, and we must seek to know the situation and the world in which the authors and the recipients lived.
* Finally, we embrace the principle of harmony, interpreting a passage in light of its context and interpreting Scripture by Scripture.” –written by New Testament churchman scholar and TCMI professor Dr. Robert Lowery

_\*Exegesis “answers the question, What did the biblical author mean? It has to do with what he said \(the content itself\) and why he said it at any given point \(the literary context\)._

Furthermore, exegesis is primarily concerned with intentionality: What did the author intend his original readers to understand?” –Gordon Fee, New Testament Exegesis
