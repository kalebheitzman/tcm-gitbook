# Book Reviews

As a TCMI student you will be expected to do critical thinking, critical reading, and critical writing. This course will provide you with the opportunity to learn, practice, and further develop these skills.

## The Writing Process

**Critical thinking** is thinking about how you think. It is an attitude of intentionally thinking past the obvious. You are curious and ask questions. You examine what you read, observe, hear, and experience thoroughly. You reflect before you react.

**Critical reading** is reading for comprehension and understanding of the content. It is seeking out what is being implied such as the authorâ€™s tone, bias, worldview perspective, and opinions versus facts. While reading you think about what you are reading. You actively read by asking questions of the author, making connections between what the author is saying and your own knowledge and life experiences.

**Critical writing** is the process of gathering, evaluating, and analyzing the evidence prior to developing a thesis and clearly and concisely presenting the argument.

## Style Guidelines

TCMI written assignments are expected to follow our [Writing Style Guidelines.](style-guides.md)

A critical book review evaluates the entire book by providing a summary, analysis, and appraisal of the book. The first step to a well-written book review, is a careful reading of the book.
