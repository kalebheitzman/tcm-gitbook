# Moodle

When first accessing your course on Moodle, start with reading the course syllabus. It contains the course plan and all instructions and details you must know. Pay special attention to the assignments and grading procedures. If you are uncertain about any of these please be sure to contact the professor early so you know what you need to do to be successful in the course. Then scroll through the course and get acquainted with the steps you need to follow. 

All courses are individually designed, but all of them have a section on Reading Resources. Here the professor lists titles which he/she considers required reading and also offers alternative reading possibilities in your own language. If these titles are available in electronic form, the Library staff may create links in Moodle to the full text of the book: the title names of these books are marked blue and you need to click on them to open and read the book. If the books which you need to read are not available in electronic form or if the links don't work, please contact &lt;library@tcmi.edu&gt;.

Make sure you get acquainted with all course requirements each time you start a new course. These change with the various professors, so you will want to pay special attention when you enroll in a new course.

Pay attention to deadlines for all requirements. This is essential for you to know these so that you do not miss these and thus either have your grade reduced, or fail the course.

All your work and activity on the course is monitored and is part of the final grade. Even if you cannot get online weekly, when you are able to access the course online your activity is monitored and documented. 

In case you see any errors on Moodle, please contact us at Admin &lt;admin@tcmi.edu&gt;.

The list of taken courses and grades is accessible on the Student Portal. As soon as the professor sends in the grades, these appear on the portal. Sometimes IP \(in progress\) will be showing under a course. This means that the course is in progress and/or the grades are not available yet. If the grade does not appear after one month since the end of the course, please contact student services. 

Any appeal to alter a grade must be made to the Vice President of Educational Advancement who will review the work and consult with the professor before making any decision.
