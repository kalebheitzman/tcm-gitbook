# Welcome

**Myron Williams, Director of Distance Learning** I remember starting graduate school many, many years ago and what I remember is how scared I was going back in school after 2 years of being away. I had no idea what the expectations were, but I soon discovered some unspoken expectations in addition to known expectations. It’s some of these unspoken expectations I want to pass along to you this week; along with some information about TCM International Institute.

### _History of TCM International Institute_

When TCM was founded her purpose was to assist the churches in Eastern Europe held captive behind the Iron Curtain in whatever ways those believers needed. TCM provided Bibles, Christian literature, benevolence items, and seminars for pastors and church leaders.

When the communist dictatorships collapsed and the Eastern European church leaders were asked what they most needed, their overwhelming response was graduate education in practical theology. Thus was born the graduate school, offering certificate, Master of Arts, and Master of Divinity degrees in Organizational Leadership, our one program.

Originally focusing on Eastern Europe, it was soon evident TCM also needed to focus on Central Asia. God had a bigger idea and soon students from other parts of the world began their courses of study. 

TCM’s history reflects its Core Values, which are a learning lifestyle, Christian maturity, servant leadership, and world Christian vision. Being committed to these core values has meant that through all the changes TCM is still committed to the following mission and vision statements:

**TCM Mission:  TCM International Institute develops Christian leaders through higher learning.**

**TCM Vision: That every nation has effective leaders of disciple making movements impacting their churches, cultures, and countries for Christ.**

As God has widened our sphere of influence we at TCM began wondering where in the world God was working and asking us to join the work the there; thus we are here. As a potential new mentoring center for TCM we want to assist you in every possible way to enroll in courses, apply for official admission, and complete a certificate or Master’s degree,
