# Integrated Reflection

Once you are admitted, every year you will enroll in the **Integrated Reflection Ministry Project.** The purpose of the **Integrated Reflection** is to measure the progress of the student on an annual basis with a final report due prior to graduation. The annual surveys will give the student and TCM an indication of the student’s ability to transfer his/her learning during the TCM experience to the contextual area of ministry or activities in disciple making. These surveys will also give an indication of the student’s practice of eight classic spiritual disciplines \(Learning, Prayer, Worship, Obedience, Solitude, Fasting, Fellowship, and Service\) and exhibiting the fruit of the Spirit \(Galatians 5:22-23\).

The Final Reflection will concentrate the student’s ideas and reflections on their pursuit of the Certificate or degree at TCM. The paper will be written from insightful interpretation of theories, facts and personal experiences of what occurred and how that event made an impact on the student. Good writing skills as well as the ability to present original insights in a creative way will greatly help to communicate the message of Christ and improve one’s ministry. The Introduction to Research course will help you with this writing.

This **Integrated Reflection is measured** by a self-assessment; an assessment from the people you are serving; and in the last year of your program by faculty who will assess a final reflective paper. 

The student accesses the Self-Evaluation form on the TCM website Self-Evaluation Form. Data from the Self-Evaluation is expected to contribute to writing the Annual Reflection. The student shall prepare and submit the Annual Reflection as a 1-page summary of his/her ministry activities and reflections for the year, describing how the courses attended at TCM during that year have impacted their ministry, personal life and spiritual development This reflection report will be uploaded on the Self-Evaluation form. The student’s Self-Evaluation and Annual Reflection are due in December each year.

An annual Survey will be used to measure the student’s ability to transfer his/her knowledge and skills to ministry activities and to ensure meeting the degree outcomes. 

An electronic survey form will be used \(see TCM website, Outside Evaluation Form\). The student will select four individuals as described in the previous section, who will automatically receive the link to the Survey form once the student submits the Self-Evaluation form. The survey results will be compiled by Student Services and forwarded to the Dean’s office for review. The student will receive feedback from the Dean’s office. The student is responsible for ensuring surveys are distributed on an annual basis. Surveys are to be completed each year during the month of December.

During the final year of study for the Certificate, M.A., and M.Div., the student will write the Final Reflection paper and submit a draft to the Dean’s office and Student Services by November 30. The final paper should be written following the TCM Form and Style Guide found on the Institute’s website, Writing Handbooks. The length of the Final Reflection paper should be between 10 and 15 pages.
