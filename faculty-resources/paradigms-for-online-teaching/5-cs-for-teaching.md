### Choice \(We’re wired for free will\) 

Guide on the Side, Not Sage on Stage

Give students a choice of activity. Required and not required. It's more up front work but giving students multiple ways of engaging content will give them the opportunity to engage content with their learning style.

* Hands On
* Reflection Sheets
* Creating Activities
* Create a Presentation
* Write Poetry
* Create a Poster

Choice is about giving students the ability to initiate and the teacher the ability to respond to student questions.

### Collaboration \(We’re wired to be social creatures\) 

### Communication \(Ditto \#2\) 

### Critical Thinking \(Problem Solving\) 

### Creativity \(a uniquely human pleasure\)

### Caring

What students will remember most is your interest in them. 

_The greatest of these is Love. –1 Corinthians 13:13_
