# Paradigms for Online Teaching

### Better Online Discussion

* [Adjust the structure of online discussions](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/online-education/organic-online-discussions-saving-time-and-increasing-engagement/) from students starting threads \(from post-and-reply-to-two\) to the instructor starting them which creates a more organic discussion structure similar to classroom conversations.
* Ask open-ended question from the deep end of Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy.
* [Pin the Instructor-initiated thread](https://moodleuserguides.org/guides/pin-thread-top-discussion-forum/) to the top of the forum to keep it in front of students.
